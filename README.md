## Theory of the module
To see more about one subject please click on the link:
- namespaces - How to preventing name conflicts in large projects. 
- stdio streams - Presentation of what is a stdio stream and how to use cin and cout.
- class & instance - A new concept of C++, an improvement of the structure in C.
- visibility - Classes also have their own private and public life.
- member attributes & functions - Variables or functions inside a class.
- accessors / getters - How to get private information, or set private information.
- this pointer - The truth behind the classes.
- const - How to save your code and your time.
- initialization list - Another way to create your constructor.
- class vs struct - Structs also exists in C++.
- structural vs. physical comparison - introduction to the equivalence of two classes.
- non member attributes & functions - C++ is not all about classes.
- C++ string - You won't use char * anymore, std::strings are the best.
- difference between std::cin and getline - std::cin is a little bit picky.
- static attributes & functions within a class - a shared variable between same classes.
